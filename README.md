Jekyll layouts for @timcw's Big presentation

### How it works:
Just drop the `_layouts` folder into the Jekyll directory you want to serve Big presentations from. If you already have layouts, just add the Big layout file.

The file `example.markdown` in `_drafts` shows a demo of how to write Big presentations using this layout.

### To-do:

 -[ ] Include the JS and CSS in a site-level directory and link them in.
 -[ ] Maybe add support for [big-themes](https://github.com/tmcw/big-themes)
 -[ ] Make it possible to write presentations with the Markdown syntax from [big.py](https://github.com/harperreed/bigpy)
